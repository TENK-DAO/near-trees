      "text": "# Introducing NearTrees\n\nBefore humans walked the Earth. Before dinosaurs were king. Before even the emergence of the trilobite… there were trees. Trees capable of growing over 100 metres tall, sustaining life, and surviving when all else falls. Yet these trees have been harbouring a secret few people understand…\n\nAt the dawn of time, before the first sprout emerged from the newborn Earth, five great elemental seeds were scattered around the planet. One seed settled on the dirt and embedded itself into the very fabric of the planet. One seed landed in the middle of the ocean and claim it as its home. One seed landed in the heart of a volcano and harnessed the fires within. One seed was cushioned by the Earth's clouds amidst the most violent of lightning storms. The final seed was caught by the winds and some say it remains in the skies to this day. Earth, wind, fire, water, and lightning. Over time, these seeds bore fruit to the most powerful trees and, over time, their powers were passed from generation to generation.\n\nSome say the extension of the dinosaurs was not in fact caused by a meteor, but a collision between the earth and fire elemental trees. Some say the ice age was triggered by the water tree. Some say the wind elemental tree is capable of conjuring the most powerful storms, and the lightning tree can destroy the very concept of human electricity with the flick of a leaf.\n\nThe elemental trees were born long before any other living creature, and they will likely still be here long after everything else is gone. Their ancient roots are entrenched in the Earth's soil, running all the way down to our planet's very core. Their trunks are among the most indestructible materials known to man. And their leaves are capable of emitting enough oxygen to sustain an entire country for a year.\n\nStudies have shown the numbers are now likely in the thousands, but no one alive today knows the exact location of the elemental trees…\n\nUntil now, that is…\n\nOur 2,555 hand-drawn NFT portraits will be published on the NEAR blockchain and have been designed with eco-friendly aims in mind. However, in order for these elemental NFTrees to emerge, we must first release our 333 minted 'seeds' which will have many benefits for the early adopters as they harness the powers of the five elements. The decision is yours… earth, wind, fire, water, or lightning. Each piece is a unique non-fungible token (NFT) and contains unique features and characteristics. It was our aim with this project to not only make a positive difference to the environment with the collection, but also provide incredible artwork and worthwhile features. So, what are you waiting for? Come and harness the powers of the elemental trees today!",
